# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard application is used to retrieve weather data from OpenWeather API based on a search of a specific city.

## Features

This application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following are rendered when a city is searched: city, date, icon image, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

The application will also display a 5-day forecast that includes the date, icon image, temperature and humidity.

A search history is formed, so whenever searching for a new city, a button will appear with the city name. The city button can be clicked on for quick reference back to that city's weather information.

The search history is saved to local storage. The clear button will clear out the search and refresh the page.

## Future Developments

A validation check for the input would be ideal and it would be great to show a map of the city location.
