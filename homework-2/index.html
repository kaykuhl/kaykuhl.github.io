        <p>
            My name is Kayla Kuhlman and I am looking to transition Careers from chemistry to software development.  
            I grew up in the northern "burbs" of the twin cities and attended Winona State University (Class of 2014).  
            During the last 5 years, I have worked as a chemist testing fire fighting foam and most recently testing road materials for the state of Minnesota. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these positions, I have also gained a lot of quality management experience (ISO 9001) which has 
            allowed me to take a step back and be able to view things from a process/quality control standpoint.  
            I have also had the opportuntiy to play around with some the laboratory databases for test results.  
            I've always liked computers but recently I've learned that this is passion I would like to pursue as a career.
        </p>  
        <p>
            I enjoy playing board games (Favorite: Terriforming Mars), baking (Favorite: Cakes), 
            Netflix (Favorite: Parks and Rec), indoor rock climbing (At Vertical Endevors!), 
            Traveling (Next March I am going to Germany), and hanging out with my two giant Siberian cats (Kronk and Maslow).
