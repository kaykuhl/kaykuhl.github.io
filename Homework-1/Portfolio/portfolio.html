            My name is Kayla Kuhlman and I am looking to transition Careers from chemistry to software development.  I grew up in the northern "burbs" of the twin cities and attended Winona State University (Class of 2014).  During the last 5 years, I have worked as a chemist testing fire fighting foam and most recently testing road materials for the state of Minnesota.

            Through these positions, I have also gained a lot of quality management experience (ISO 9001) which has allowed me to take a step back and be able to view things from a process/quality control standpoint.  I have also had the opportuntiy to play around with some the laboratory databases for test results.  I've always liked computers but recently I've learned that this is passion I would like to

            I enjoy playing board games (Favorite: Terriforming Mars), baking (Favorite: Cakes), Netflix (Favorite: Parks and Rec), indoor rock climbing (At Vertical Endevors!), Traveling (Next March I am going to Germany), and hanging out with my two giant Siberian cats (Kronk and Maslow).
